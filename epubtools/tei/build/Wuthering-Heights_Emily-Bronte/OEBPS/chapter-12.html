</h2>



 

<p id="id1032975"><span id="id115778"><!--anchor--></span>
WHILE Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent,
and almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among
books that he never opened - wearying, I guessed, with a continual
vague expectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come
of her own accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation - and
SHE fasted pertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every
meal Edgar was ready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held
him from running to cast himself at her feet; I went about my
household duties, convinced that the Grange had but one sensible
soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body.  I wasted no
condolences on Miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did
I pay much attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear
his lady’s name, since he might not hear her voice.  I determined
they should come about as they pleased for me; and though it was a
tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint
dawn of its progress:  as I thought at first.
</p>

<p id="id1032980"><span id="id115785"><!--anchor--></span>
Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having
finished the water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed
supply, and a basin of gruel, for she believed she was dying.  That
I set down as a speech meant for Edgar’s ears; I believed no such
thing, so I kept it to myself and brought her some tea and dry
toast.  She ate and drank eagerly, and sank back on her pillow
again, clenching her hands and groaning.  ’Oh, I will die,’ she
exclaimed, ’since no one cares anything about me.  I wish I had not
taken that.’  Then a good while after I heard her murmur, ’No, I’ll
not die - he’d be glad - he does not love me at all - he would
never miss me!’
</p>

<p id="id1032977"><span id="id115796"><!--anchor--></span>
’Did you want anything, ma’am?’ I inquired, still preserving my
external composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and
strange, exaggerated manner.
</p>

<p id="id1032986"><span id="id115793"><!--anchor--></span>
’What is that apathetic being doing?’ she demanded, pushing the
thick entangled locks from her wasted face.  ’Has he fallen into a
lethargy, or is he dead?’
</p>

<p id="id1032998"><span id="id115818"><!--anchor--></span>
’Neither,’ replied I; ’if you mean Mr. Linton.  He’s tolerably
well, I think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they
ought:  he is continually among his books, since he has no other
society.’
</p>

<p id="id1032984"><span id="id115833"><!--anchor--></span>
I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but
I could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her
disorder.
</p>

<p id="id1033014"><span id="id115842"><!--anchor--></span>
’Among his books!’ she cried, confounded.  ’And I dying!  I on the
brink of the grave!  My God! does he know how I’m altered?’
continued she, staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging
against the opposite wall.  ’Is that Catherine Linton?   He
imagines me in a pet - in play, perhaps.  Cannot you inform him
that it is frightful earnest?  Nelly, if it be not too late, as
soon as I learn how he feels, I’ll choose between these two:
either to starve at once - that would be no punishment unless he
had a heart - or to recover, and leave the country.  Are you
speaking the truth about him now?  Take care.  Is he actually so
utterly indifferent for my life?’
</p>

<p id="id1033017"><span id="id115849"><!--anchor--></span>
’Why, ma’am,’ I answered, ’the master has no idea of your being
deranged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself
die of hunger.’
</p>

<p id="id1033025"><span id="id115861"><!--anchor--></span>
’You think not?  Cannot you tell him I will?’ she returned.
’Persuade him! speak of your own mind:  say you are certain I
will!’
</p>

<p id="id1033007"><span id="id115873"><!--anchor--></span>
’No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,’ I suggested, ’that you have eaten
some food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will
perceive its good effects.’
</p>

<p id="id1033040"><span id="id115886"><!--anchor--></span>
’If I were only sure it would kill him,’ she interrupted, ’I’d kill
myself directly!  These three awful nights I’ve never closed my
lids - and oh, I’ve been tormented!  I’ve been haunted, Nelly!  But
I begin to fancy you don’t like me.  How strange!  I thought,
though everybody hated and despised each other, they could not
avoid loving me.  And they have all turned to enemies in a few
hours:  they have, I’m positive; the people here.  How dreary to
meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!  Isabella, terrified
and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be so dreadful to
watch Catherine go.  And Edgar standing solemnly by to see it over;
then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to his
house, and going back to his BOOKS!  What in the name of all that
feels has he to do with BOOKS, when I am dying?’
</p>

<p id="id1033043"><span id="id115893"><!--anchor--></span>
She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.
Linton’s philosophical resignation.  Tossing about, she increased
her feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her
teeth; then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would
open the window.  We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew
strong from the north-east, and I objected.  Both the expressions
flitting over her face, and the changes of her moods, began to
alarm me terribly; and brought to my recollection her former
illness, and the doctor’s injunction that she should not be
crossed.  A minute previously she was violent; now, supported on
one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed to
find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she
had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their
different species:  her mind had strayed to other associations.
</p>

<p id="id1033046"><span id="id115901"><!--anchor--></span>
’That’s a turkey’s,’ she murmured to herself; ’and this is a wild
duck’s; and this is a pigeon’s.  Ah, they put pigeons’ feathers in
the pillows - no wonder I couldn’t die!  Let me take care to throw
it on the floor when I lie down.  And here is a moor-cock’s; and
this - I should know it among a thousand - it’s a lapwing’s.  Bonny
bird; wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor.  It wanted
to get to its nest, for the clouds had touched the swells, and it
felt rain coming.  This feather was picked up from the heath, the
bird was not shot:  we saw its nest in the winter, full of little
skeletons.  Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old ones dared
not come.  I made him promise he’d never shoot a lapwing after
that, and he didn’t.  Yes, here are more!  Did he shoot my
lapwings, Nelly?  Are they red, any of them?  Let me look.’
</p>

<p id="id1033050"><span id="id115907"><!--anchor--></span>
’Give over with that baby-work!’ I interrupted, dragging the pillow
away, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was
removing its contents by handfuls.  ’Lie down and shut your eyes:
you’re wandering.  There’s a mess!  The down is flying about like
snow.’
</p>

<p id="id1033053"><span id="id115914"><!--anchor--></span>
I went here and there collecting it.
</p>

<p id="id1033056"><span id="id115922"><!--anchor--></span>
’I see in you, Nelly,’ she continued dreamily, ’an aged woman:  you
have grey hair and bent shoulders.  This bed is the fairy cave
under Penistone crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our
heifers; pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of
wool.  That’s what you’ll come to fifty years hence:  I know you
are not so now.  I’m not wandering:  you’re mistaken, or else I
should believe you really WERE that withered hag, and I should
think I WAS under Penistone Crags; and I’m conscious it’s night,
and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine
like jet.’
</p>

<p id="id1033061"><span id="id115929"><!--anchor--></span>
’The black press? where is that?’ I asked.  ’You are talking in
your sleep!’
</p>

<p id="id1033064"><span id="id115939"><!--anchor--></span>
’It’s against the wall, as it always is,’ she replied.  ’It DOES
appear odd - I see a face in it!’
</p>

<p id="id1033073"><span id="id115950"><!--anchor--></span>
’There’s no press in the room, and never was,’ said I, resuming my
seat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.
</p>

<p id="id1033081"><span id="id115961"><!--anchor--></span>
’Don’t YOU see that face?’ she inquired, gazing earnestly at the
mirror.
</p>

<p id="id1033086"><span id="id115971"><!--anchor--></span>
And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it
to be her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.
</p>

<p id="id1033094"><span id="id115980"><!--anchor--></span>
’It’s behind there still!’ she pursued, anxiously.  ’And it
stirred.  Who is it?  I hope it will not come out when you are
gone!  Oh!  Nelly, the room is haunted!  I’m afraid of being
alone!’
</p>

<p id="id1033058"><span id="id115994"><!--anchor--></span>
I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession
of shudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her
gaze towards the glass.
</p>

<p id="id1033109"><span id="id116004"><!--anchor--></span>
’There’s nobody here!’ I insisted.  ’It was YOURSELF, Mrs. Linton:
you knew it a while since.’
</p>

<p id="id1033116"><span id="id116015"><!--anchor--></span>
’Myself!’ she gasped, ’and the clock is striking twelve!  It’s
true, then! that’s dreadful!’
</p>

<p id="id1033102"><span id="id116026"><!--anchor--></span>
Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes.
I attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her
husband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek - the shawl
had dropped from the frame.
</p>

<p id="id1033130"><span id="id116036"><!--anchor--></span>
’Why, what is the matter?’ cried I.  ’Who is coward now?  Wake up!
That is the glass - the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself
in it, and there am I too by your side.’
</p>

<p id="id1033138"><span id="id116049"><!--anchor--></span>
Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror
gradually passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a
glow of shame.
</p>

<p id="id1033123"><span id="id116058"><!--anchor--></span>
’Oh, dear!  I thought I was at home,’ she sighed.  ’I thought I was
lying in my chamber at Wuthering Heights.  Because I’m weak, my
brain got confused, and I screamed unconsciously.  Don’t say
anything; but stay with me.  I dread sleeping:  my dreams appal
me.’
</p>

<p id="id1033153"><span id="id116065"><!--anchor--></span>
’A sound sleep would do you good, ma’am,’ I answered:  ’and I hope
this suffering will prevent your trying starving again.’
</p>

<p id="id1033161"><span id="id116076"><!--anchor--></span>
’Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!’ she went on
bitterly, wringing her hands.  ’And that wind sounding in the firs
by the lattice.  Do let me feel it - it comes straight down the
moor - do let me have one breath!’  To pacify her I held the
casement ajar a few seconds.  A cold blast rushed through; I closed
it, and returned to my post.  She lay still now, her face bathed in
tears.  Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit:  our
fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.
</p>

<p id="id1033164"><span id="id116083"><!--anchor--></span>
’How long is it since I shut myself in here?’ she asked, suddenly
reviving.
</p>

<p id="id1033170"><span id="id116093"><!--anchor--></span>
’It was Monday evening,’ I replied, ’and this is Thursday night, or
rather Friday morning, at present.’
</p>

<p id="id1033177"><span id="id116104"><!--anchor--></span>
’What! of the same week?’ she exclaimed.  ’Only that brief time?’
</p>

<p id="id1033183"><span id="id116113"><!--anchor--></span>
’Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,’
observed I.
</p>

<p id="id1033189"><span id="id116124"><!--anchor--></span>
’Well, it seems a weary number of hours,’ she muttered doubtfully:
’it must be more.  I remember being in the parlour after they had
quarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into
this room desperate.  As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter
blackness overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor.  I couldn’t
explain to Edgar how certain I felt of having a fit, or going
raging mad, if he persisted in teasing me!  I had no command of
tongue, or brain, and he did not guess my agony, perhaps:  it
barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice.
Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to be
dawn, and, Nelly, I’ll tell you what I thought, and what has kept
recurring and recurring till I feared for my reason.  I thought as
I lay there, with my head against that table leg, and my eyes dimly
discerning the grey square of the window, that I was enclosed in
the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some great
grief which, just waking, I could not recollect.  I pondered, and
worried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely,
the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank!  I did not
recall that they had been at all.  I was a child; my father was
just buried, and my misery arose from the separation that Hindley
had ordered between me and Heathcliff.  I was laid alone, for the
first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a night of
weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside:  it struck the
table-top!  I swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in:
my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair.  I cannot
say why I felt so wildly wretched:  it must have been temporary
derangement; for there is scarcely cause.  But, supposing at twelve
years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early
association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and
been converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of
Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger:  an exile, and
outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world.  You may fancy a
glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled!  Shake your head as you
will, Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me!  You should have
spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me
quiet!  Oh, I’m burning!  I wish I were out of doors!  I wish I
were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and laughing at
injuries, not maddening under them!  Why am I so changed? why does
my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words?  I’m sure I
should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills.
Open the window again wide:  fasten it open!  Quick, why don’t you
move?’
</p>

<p id="id1033192"><span id="id116131"><!--anchor--></span>
’Because I won’t give you your death of cold,’ I answered.
</p>

<p id="id1033146"><span id="id116140"><!--anchor--></span>
’You won’t give me a chance of life, you mean,’ she said, sullenly.
’However, I’m not helpless yet; I’ll open it myself.’
</p>

<p id="id1033205"><span id="id116151"><!--anchor--></span>
And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the
room, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out,
careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as
a knife.  I entreated, and finally attempted to force her to
retire.  But I soon found her delirious strength much surpassed
mine (she was delirious, I became convinced by her subsequent
actions and ravings).  There was no moon, and everything beneath
lay in misty darkness:  not a light gleamed from any house, far or
near all had been extinguished long ago:  and those at Wuthering
Heights were never visible - still she asserted she caught their
shining.
</p>

<p id="id1033208"><span id="id116158"><!--anchor--></span>
’Look!’ she cried eagerly, ’that’s my room with the candle in it,
and the trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in
Joseph’s garret.  Joseph sits up late, doesn’t he?  He’s waiting
till I come home that he may lock the gate.  Well, he’ll wait a
while yet.  It’s a rough journey, and a sad heart to travel it; and
we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go that journey!  We’ve braved
its ghosts often together, and dared each other to stand among the
graves and ask them to come.  But, Heathcliff, if I dare you now,
will you venture?  If you do, I’ll keep you.  I’ll not lie there by
myself:  they may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the church
down over me, but I won’t rest till you are with me.  I never
will!’
</p>

<p id="id1033212"><span id="id116164"><!--anchor--></span>
She paused, and resumed with a strange smile.  ’He’s considering -
he’d rather I’d come to him!  Find a way, then! not through that
kirkyard.  You are slow!  Be content, you always followed me!’
</p>

<p id="id1033215"><span id="id116178"><!--anchor--></span>
Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning
how I could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my
hold of herself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping
lattice), when, to my consternation, I heard the rattle of the
door-handle, and Mr. Linton entered.  He had only then come from
the library; and, in passing through the lobby, had noticed our
talking and been attracted by curiosity, or fear, to examine what
it signified, at that late hour.
</p>

<p id="id1033223"><span id="id116193"><!--anchor--></span>
’Oh, sir!’ I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at
the sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber.
’My poor mistress is ill, and she quite masters me:  I cannot
manage her at all; pray, come and persuade her to go to bed.
Forget your anger, for she’s hard to guide any way but her own.’
</p>

<p id="id1033226"><span id="id116200"><!--anchor--></span>
’Catherine ill?’ he said, hastening to us.  ’Shut the window,
Ellen!  Catherine! why - ’
</p>

<p id="id1033198"><span id="id116210"><!--anchor--></span>
He was silent.  The haggardness of Mrs. Linton’s appearance smote
him speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in
horrified astonishment.
</p>

<p id="id1033241"><span id="id116223"><!--anchor--></span>
’She’s been fretting here,’ I continued, ’and eating scarcely
anything, and never complaining:  she would admit none of us till
this evening, and so we couldn’t inform you of her state, as we
were not aware of it ourselves; but it is nothing.’
</p>

<p id="id1033234"><span id="id116229"><!--anchor--></span>
I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned.
’It is nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?’ he said sternly.  ’You shall
account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!’  And he took
his wife in his arms, and looked at her with anguish.
</p>

<p id="id1033256"><span id="id116238"><!--anchor--></span>
At first she gave him no glance of recognition:  he was invisible
to her abstracted gaze.  The delirium was not fixed, however;
having weaned her eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by
degrees she centred her attention on him, and discovered who it was
that held her.
</p>

<p id="id1033260"><span id="id116249"><!--anchor--></span>
’Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?’ she said, with angry
animation.  ’You are one of those things that are ever found when
least wanted, and when you are wanted, never!  I suppose we shall
have plenty of lamentations now - I see we shall - but they can’t
keep me from my narrow home out yonder:  my resting-place, where
I’m bound before spring is over!  There it is:  not among the
Lintons, mind, under the chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a
head-stone; and you may please yourself whether you go to them or
come to me!’
</p>

<p id="id1033263"><span id="id116256"><!--anchor--></span>
’Catherine, what have you done?’ commenced the master.  ’Am I
nothing to you any more?  Do you love that wretch Heath - ’
</p>

<p id="id1033249"><span id="id116267"><!--anchor--></span>
’Hush!’ cried Mrs. Linton.  ’Hush, this moment!  You mention that
name and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window!
What you touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that
hill-top before you lay hands on me again.  I don’t want you,
Edgar:  I’m past wanting you.  Return to your books.  I’m glad you
possess a consolation, for all you had in me is gone.’
</p>

<p id="id1033274"><span id="id116274"><!--anchor--></span>
’Her mind wanders, sir,’ I interposed.  ’She has been talking
nonsense the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper
attendance, and she’ll rally.  Hereafter, we must be cautious how
we vex her.’
</p>

<p id="id1033272"><span id="id116288"><!--anchor--></span>
’I desire no further advice from you,’ answered Mr. Linton.  ’You
knew your mistress’s nature, and you encouraged me to harass her.
And not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days!
It was heartless!  Months of sickness could not cause such a
change!’
</p>

<p id="id1033285"><span id="id116295"><!--anchor--></span>
I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for
another’s wicked waywardness.  ’I knew Mrs. Linton’s nature to be
headstrong and domineering,’ cried I:  ’but I didn’t know that you
wished to foster her fierce temper!  I didn’t know that, to humour
her, I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff.  I performed the duty of a
faithful servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful
servant’s wages!  Well, it will teach me to be careful next time.
Next time you may gather intelligence for yourself!’
</p>

<p id="id1033283"><span id="id116303"><!--anchor--></span>
’The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service,
Ellen Dean,’ he replied.
</p>

<p id="id1033292"><span id="id116312"><!--anchor--></span>
’You’d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?’
said I.  ’Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to
Miss, and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on
purpose to poison the mistress against you?’
</p>

<p id="id1033303"><span id="id116319"><!--anchor--></span>
Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our
conversation.
</p>

<p id="id1033290"><span id="id116327"><!--anchor--></span>
’Ah!  Nelly has played traitor,’ she exclaimed, passionately.
’Nelly is my hidden enemy.  You witch!  So you do seek elf-bolts to
hurt us!  Let me go, and I’ll make her rue!  I’ll make her howl a
recantation!’
</p>

<p id="id1033316"><span id="id116342"><!--anchor--></span>
A maniac’s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately
to disengage herself from Linton’s arms.  I felt no inclination to
tarry the event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own
responsibility, I quitted the chamber.
</p>

<p id="id1033325"><span id="id116357"><!--anchor--></span>
In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle
hook is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved
irregularly, evidently by another agent than the wind.
Notwithstanding my hurry, I stayed to examine it, lest ever after I
should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was
a creature of the other world.  My surprise and perplexity were
great on discovering, by touch more than vision, Miss Isabella’s
springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and nearly at its
last gasp.  I quickly released the animal, and lifted it into the
garden.  I had seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she went
to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what
mischievous person had treated it so.  While untying the knot round
the hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the beat of
horses’ feet galloping at some distance; but there were such a
number of things to occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the
circumstance a thought:  though it was a strange sound, in that
place, at two o’clock in the morning.
</p>

<p id="id1033328"><span id="id116365"><!--anchor--></span>
Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a
patient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of
Catherine Linton’s malady induced him to accompany me back
immediately.  He was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to
speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack; unless she
were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself
before.
</p>

<p id="id1033331"><span id="id116375"><!--anchor--></span>
’Nelly Dean,’ said he, ’I can’t help fancying there’s an extra
cause for this.  What has there been to do at the Grange?  We’ve
odd reports up here.  A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not
fall ill for a trifle; and that sort of people should not either.
It’s hard work bringing them through fevers, and such things.  How
did it begin?’
</p>

<p id="id1033318"><span id="id116379"><!--anchor--></span>
’The master will inform you,’ I answered; ’but you are acquainted
with the Earnshaws’ violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them
all.  I may say this; it commenced in a quarrel.  She was struck
during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit.  That’s her
account, at least:  for she flew off in the height of it, and
locked herself up.  Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now she
alternately raves and remains in a half dream; knowing those about
her, but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and
illusions.’
</p>

<p id="id1033338"><span id="id116385"><!--anchor--></span>
’Mr. Linton will be sorry?’ observed Kenneth, interrogatively.
</p>

<p id="id1033336"><span id="id116395"><!--anchor--></span>
’ Sorry? he’ll break his heart should anything happen!’ I replied.
’Don’t alarm him more than necessary.’
</p>

<p id="id1033351"><span id="id116406"><!--anchor--></span>
’Well, I told him to beware,’ said my companion; ’and he must bide
the consequences of neglecting my warning!  Hasn’t he been intimate
with Mr. Heathcliff lately?’
</p>

<p id="id1033359"><span id="id116418"><!--anchor--></span>
’Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,’ answered I, ’though
more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy,
than because the master likes his company.  At present he’s
discharged from the trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous
aspirations after Miss Linton which he manifested.  I hardly think
he’ll be taken in again.’
</p>

<p id="id1033362"><span id="id116426"><!--anchor--></span>
’And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?’ was the
doctor’s next question.
</p>

<p id="id1033345"><span id="id116436"><!--anchor--></span>
’I’m not in her confidence,’ returned I, reluctant to continue the
subject.
</p>

<p id="id1033374"><span id="id116446"><!--anchor--></span>
’No, she’s a sly one,’ he remarked, shaking his head.  ’She keeps
her own counsel!  But she’s a real little fool.  I have it from
good authority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and
Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house
above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just
mount his horse and away with him!  My informant said she could
only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on
their first meeting after that:  when it was to be he didn’t hear;
but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp!’
</p>

<p id="id1033378"><span id="id116452"><!--anchor--></span>
This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and
ran most of the way back.  The little dog was yelping in the garden
yet.  I spared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of
going to the house door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass,
and would have escaped to the road, had I not seized it and
conveyed it in with me.  On ascending to Isabella’s room, my
suspicions were confirmed:  it was empty.  Had I been a few hours
sooner Mrs. Linton’s illness might have arrested her rash step.
But what could be done now?  There was a bare possibility of
overtaking them if pursued instantly.  I could not pursue them,
however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place with
confusion; still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as
he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to spare for a
second grief!  I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue, and
suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I
went with a badly composed countenance to announce him.  Catherine
lay in a troubled sleep:  her husband had succeeded in soothing the
excess of frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade
and every change of her painfully expressive features.
</p>

<p id="id1033381"><span id="id116459"><!--anchor--></span>
The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to
him of its having a favourable termination, if we could only
preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity.  To me, he
signified the threatening danger was not so much death, as
permanent alienation of intellect.
</p>

<p id="id1033384"><span id="id116472"><!--anchor--></span>
I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton:  indeed, we
never went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the
usual hour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and
exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their
vocations.  Every one was active but Miss Isabella; and they began
to remark how sound she slept:  her brother, too, asked if she had
risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, and hurt that she
showed so little anxiety for her sister-in-law.  I trembled lest he
should send me to call her; but I was spared the pain of being the
first proclaimant of her flight.  One of the maids, a thoughtless
girl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting
up-stairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying:  ’Oh,
dear, dear!  What mun we have next?  Master, master, our young lady
- ’
</p>

<p id="id1033387"><span id="id116478"><!--anchor--></span>
’Hold your noise!’ cried, I hastily, enraged at her clamorous
manner.
</p>

<p id="id1033369"><span id="id116488"><!--anchor--></span>
’Speak lower, Mary - What is the matter?’ said Mr. Linton.  ’What
ails your young lady?’
</p>

<p id="id1033400"><span id="id116498"><!--anchor--></span>
’She’s gone, she’s gone!  Yon’ Heathcliff’s run off wi’ her!’
gasped the girl.
</p>

<p id="id1033394"><span id="id116508"><!--anchor--></span>
’That is not true!’ exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation.  ’It
cannot be:  how has the idea entered your head?  Ellen Dean, go and
seek her.  It is incredible:  it cannot be.’
</p>

<p id="id1033414"><span id="id116521"><!--anchor--></span>
As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his
demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.
</p>

<p id="id1033421"><span id="id116531"><!--anchor--></span>
’Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,’ she
stammered, ’and he asked whether we weren’t in trouble at the
Grange.  I thought he meant for missis’s sickness, so I answered,
yes.  Then says he, “There’s somebody gone after ’em, I guess?”  I
stared.  He saw I knew nought about it, and he told how a gentleman
and lady had stopped to have a horse’s shoe fastened at a
blacksmith’s shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not very long after
midnight! and how the blacksmith’s lass had got up to spy who they
were:  she knew them both directly.  And she noticed the man -
Heathcliff it was, she felt certain:  nob’dy could mistake him,
besides - put a sovereign in her father’s hand for payment.  The
lady had a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water,
while she drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain.
Heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on, and they set their
faces from the village, and went as fast as the rough roads would
let them.  The lass said nothing to her father, but she told it all
over Gimmerton this morning.’
</p>

<p id="id1033407"><span id="id116537"><!--anchor--></span>
I ran and peeped, for form’s sake, into Isabella’s room;
confirming, when I returned, the servant’s statement.  Mr. Linton
had resumed his seat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his
eyes, read the meaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without
giving an order, or uttering a word.
</p>

<p id="id1033426"><span id="id116545"><!--anchor--></span>
’Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,’
I inquired.  ’How should we do?’
</p>

<p id="id1033431"><span id="id116556"><!--anchor--></span>
’She went of her own accord,’ answered the master; ’she had a right
to go if she pleased.  Trouble me no more about her.  Hereafter she
is only my sister in name:  not because I disown her, but because
she has disowned me.’
</p>

<p id="id1033443"><span id="id116570"><!--anchor--></span>
And that was all he said on the subject:  he did not make single
inquiry further, or mention her in any way, except directing me to
send what property she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever
it was, when I knew it.
