</h2>




<p id="id1032620"><span id="id115125"><!--anchor--></span>
SOMETIMES, while meditating on these things in solitude, I’ve got
up in a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was
at the farm.  I’ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to
warn him how people talked regarding his ways; and then I’ve
recollected his confirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting
him, have flinched from re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I
could bear to be taken at my word.
</p>

<p id="id1032624"><span id="id115132"><!--anchor--></span>
One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey
to Gimmerton.  It was about the period that my narrative has
reached:  a bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road
hard and dry.  I came to a stone where the highway branches off on
to the moor at your left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the
letters W. H. cut on its north side, on the east, G., and on the
south-west, T. G.  It serves as a guide-post to the Grange, the
Heights, and village.  The sun shone yellow on its grey head,
reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all at once a
gush of child’s sensations flowed into my heart.  Hindley and I
held it a favourite spot twenty years before.  I gazed long at the
weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the
bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond
of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as
reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the
withered turf:  his dark, square head bent forward, and his little
hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate.  ’Poor Hindley!’
I exclaimed, involuntarily.  I started:  my bodily eye was cheated
into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared
straight into mine!  It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I
felt an irresistible yearning to be at the Heights.  Superstition
urged me to comply with this impulse:  supposing he should be dead!
I thought - or should die soon! - supposing it were a sign of
death!  The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and
on catching sight of it I trembled in every limb.  The apparition
had outstripped me:  it stood looking through the gate.  That was
my first idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting
his ruddy countenance against the bars.  Further reflection
suggested this must be Hareton, MY Hareton, not altered greatly
since I left him, ten months since.
</p>

<p id="id1032628"><span id="id115138"><!--anchor--></span>
’God bless thee, darling!’ I cried, forgetting instantaneously my
foolish fears.  ’Hareton, it’s Nelly!  Nelly, thy nurse.’
</p>

<p id="id1032631"><span id="id115150"><!--anchor--></span>
He retreated out of arm’s length, and picked up a large flint.
</p>

<p id="id1032622"><span id="id115160"><!--anchor--></span>
’I am come to see thy father, Hareton,’ I added, guessing from the
action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not
recognised as one with me.
</p>

<p id="id1032649"><span id="id115173"><!--anchor--></span>
He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech,
but could not stay his hand:  the stone struck my bonnet; and then
ensued, from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of
curses, which, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered
with practised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a
shocking expression of malignity.  You may be certain this grieved
more than angered me.  Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket,
and offered it to propitiate him.  He hesitated, and then snatched
it from my hold; as if he fancied I only intended to tempt and
disappoint him.  I showed another, keeping it out of his reach.
</p>

<p id="id1032652"><span id="id115179"><!--anchor--></span>
’Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?’ I inquired.  ’The
curate?’
</p>

<p id="id1032658"><span id="id115189"><!--anchor--></span>
’Damn the curate, and thee!  Gie me that,’ he replied.
</p>

<p id="id1032642"><span id="id115197"><!--anchor--></span>
’Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,’ said
I.  ’Who’s your master?’
</p>

<p id="id1032670"><span id="id115208"><!--anchor--></span>
’Devil daddy,’ was his answer.
</p>

<p id="id1032673"><span id="id115216"><!--anchor--></span>
’And what do you learn from daddy?’ I continued.
</p>

<p id="id1032678"><span id="id115225"><!--anchor--></span>
He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher.  ’What does he teach
you?’ I asked.
</p>

<p id="id1032686"><span id="id115236"><!--anchor--></span>
’Naught,’ said he, ’but to keep out of his gait.  Daddy cannot bide
me, because I swear at him.’
</p>

<p id="id1032693"><span id="id115246"><!--anchor--></span>
’Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?’ I observed.
</p>

<p id="id1032681"><span id="id115256"><!--anchor--></span>
’Ay - nay,’ he drawled.
</p>

<p id="id1032701"><span id="id115264"><!--anchor--></span>
’Who, then?’
</p>

<p id="id1032705"><span id="id115272"><!--anchor--></span>
’Heathcliff.’
</p>

<p id="id1032708"><span id="id115280"><!--anchor--></span>
’I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.’
</p>

<p id="id1032712"><span id="id115289"><!--anchor--></span>
’Ay!’ he answered again.
</p>

<p id="id1032717"><span id="id115297"><!--anchor--></span>
Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather
the sentences - ’I known’t:  he pays dad back what he gies to me -
he curses daddy for cursing me.  He says I mun do as I will.’
</p>

<p id="id1032726"><span id="id115312"><!--anchor--></span>
’And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?’ I
pursued.
</p>

<p id="id1032719"><span id="id115321"><!--anchor--></span>
’No, I was told the curate should have his - teeth dashed down his
- throat, if he stepped over the threshold - Heathcliff had
promised that!’
</p>

<p id="id1032739"><span id="id115333"><!--anchor--></span>
I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a
woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the
garden gate.  He went up the walk, and entered the house; but,
instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I
turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever I could race,
making no halt till I gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared
as if I had raised a goblin.  This is not much connected with Miss
Isabella’s affair:  except that it urged me to resolve further on
mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to cheek the spread of
such bad influence at the Grange:  even though I should wake a
domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton’s pleasure.
</p>

<p id="id1032742"><span id="id115340"><!--anchor--></span>
The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding
some pigeons in the court.  She had never spoken a word to her
sister-in-law for three days; but she had likewise dropped her
fretful complaining, and we found it a great comfort.  Heathcliff
had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on
Miss Linton, I knew.  Now, as soon as he beheld her, his first
precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house-front.  I was
standing by the kitchen-window, but I drew out of sight.  He then
stepped across the pavement to her, and said something:  she seemed
embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he laid
his hand on her arm.  She averted her face:  he apparently put some
question which she had no mind to answer.  There was another rapid
glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel
had the impudence to embrace her.
</p>

<p id="id1032746"><span id="id115347"><!--anchor--></span>
’Judas!  Traitor!’ I ejaculated.  ’You are a hypocrite, too, are
you?  A deliberate deceiver.’
</p>

<p id="id1032749"><span id="id115357"><!--anchor--></span>
’Who is, Nelly?’ said Catherine’s voice at my elbow:  I had been
over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.
</p>

<p id="id1032760"><span id="id115369"><!--anchor--></span>
’Your worthless friend!’ I answered, warmly:  ’the sneaking rascal
yonder.  Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us - he is coming in!  I
wonder will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making
love to Miss, when he told you he hated her?’
</p>

<p id="id1032768"><span id="id115376"><!--anchor--></span>
Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the
garden; and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door.  I couldn’t
withhold giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily
insisted on silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen,
if I dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.
</p>

<p id="id1032733"><span id="id115385"><!--anchor--></span>
’To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!’ she cried.
’You want setting down in your right place!  Heathcliff, what are
you about, raising this stir?  I said you must let Isabella alone!
- I beg you will, unless you are tired of being received here, and
wish Linton to draw the bolts against you!’
</p>

<p id="id1032775"><span id="id115390"><!--anchor--></span>
’God forbid that he should try!’ answered the black villain.  I
detested him just then.  ’God keep him meek and patient!  Every day
I grow madder after sending him to heaven!’
</p>

<p id="id1032778"><span id="id115404"><!--anchor--></span>
’Hush!’ said Catherine, shutting the inner door!  ’Don’t vex me.
Why have you disregarded my request?  Did she come across you on
purpose?’
</p>

<p id="id1032790"><span id="id115416"><!--anchor--></span>
’What is it to you?’ he growled.  ’I have a right to kiss her, if
she chooses; and you have no right to object.  I am not YOUR
husband:  YOU needn’t be jealous of me!’
</p>

<p id="id1032798"><span id="id115429"><!--anchor--></span>
’I’m not jealous of you,’ replied the mistress; ’I’m jealous for
you.  Clear your face:  you sha’n’t scowl at me!  If you like
Isabella, you shall marry her.  But do you like her?  Tell the
truth, Heathcliff!  There, you won’t answer.  I’m certain you
don’t.’
</p>

<p id="id1032801"><span id="id115437"><!--anchor--></span>
’And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?’ I
inquired.
</p>

<p id="id1032807"><span id="id115447"><!--anchor--></span>
’Mr. Linton should approve,’ returned my lady, decisively.
</p>

<p id="id1032772"><span id="id115456"><!--anchor--></span>
’He might spare himself the trouble,’ said Heathcliff:  ’I could do
as well without his approbation.  And as to you, Catherine, I have
a mind to speak a few words now, while we are at it.  I want you to
be aware that I KNOW you have treated me infernally - infernally!
Do you hear?  And if you flatter yourself that I don’t perceive it,
you are a fool; and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words,
you are an idiot:  and if you fancy I’ll suffer unrevenged, I’ll
convince you of the contrary, in a very little while!  Meantime,
thank you for telling me your sister-in-law’s secret:  I swear I’ll
make the most of it.  And stand you aside!’
</p>

<p id="id1032816"><span id="id115464"><!--anchor--></span>
’What new phase of his character is this?’ exclaimed Mrs. Linton,
in amazement.  ’I’ve treated you infernally - and you’ll take your
revenge!  How will you take it, ungrateful brute?  How have I
treated you infernally?’
</p>

<p id="id1032824"><span id="id115479"><!--anchor--></span>
’I seek no revenge on you,’ replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.
’That’s not the plan.  The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they
don’t turn against him; they crush those beneath them.  You are
welcome to torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to
amuse myself a little in the same style, and refrain from insult as
much as you are able.  Having levelled my palace, don’t erect a
hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that
for a home.  If I imagined you really wished me to marry Isabel,
I’d cut my throat!’
</p>

<p id="id1032827"><span id="id115486"><!--anchor--></span>
’Oh, the evil is that I am NOT jealous, is it?’ cried Catherine.
’Well, I won’t repeat my offer of a wife:  it is as bad as offering
Satan a lost soul.  Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting
misery.  You prove it.  Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he
gave way to at your coming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and
you, restless to know us at peace, appear resolved on exciting a
quarrel.  Quarrel with Edgar, if you please, Heathcliff, and
deceive his sister:  you’ll hit on exactly the most efficient
method of revenging yourself on me.’
</p>

<p id="id1032830"><span id="id115493"><!--anchor--></span>
The conversation ceased.  Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed
and gloomy.  The spirit which served her was growing intractable:
she could neither lay nor control it.  He stood on the hearth with
folded arms, brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I
left them to seek the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine
below so long.
</p>

<p id="id1032833"><span id="id115505"><!--anchor--></span>
’Ellen,’ said he, when I entered, ’have you seen your mistress?’
</p>

<p id="id1032840"><span id="id115515"><!--anchor--></span>
’Yes; she’s in the kitchen, sir,’ I answered.  ’She’s sadly put out
by Mr. Heathcliff’s behaviour:  and, indeed, I do think it’s time
to arrange his visits on another footing.  There’s harm in being
too soft, and now it’s come to this - .’  And I related the scene
in the court, and, as near as I dared, the whole subsequent
dispute.  I fancied it could not be very prejudicial to Mrs.
Linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming the defensive
for her guest.  Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the
close.  His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of
blame.
</p>

<p id="id1032843"><span id="id115521"><!--anchor--></span>
’This is insufferable!’ he exclaimed.  ’It is disgraceful that she
should own him for a friend, and force his company on me!  Call me
two men out of the hall, Ellen.  Catherine shall linger no longer
to argue with the low ruffian - I have humoured her enough.’
</p>

<p id="id1032851"><span id="id115529"><!--anchor--></span>
He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,
followed by me, to the kitchen.  Its occupants had recommenced
their angry discussion:  Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with
renewed vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his
head, somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently.  He saw the
master first, and made a hasty motion that she should be silent;
which she obeyed, abruptly, on discovering the reason of his
intimation.
</p>

<p id="id1032854"><span id="id115544"><!--anchor--></span>
’How is this?’ said Linton, addressing her; ’what notion of
propriety must you have to remain here, after the language which
has been held to you by that blackguard?  I suppose, because it is
his ordinary talk you think nothing of it:  you are habituated to
his baseness, and, perhaps, imagine I can get used to it too!’
</p>

<p id="id1032813"><span id="id115551"><!--anchor--></span>
’Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?’ asked the mistress,
in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying
both carelessness and contempt of his irritation.  Heathcliff, who
had raised his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at
the latter; on purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton’s attention
to him.  He succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with
any high flights of passion.
</p>

<p id="id1032861"><span id="id115558"><!--anchor--></span>
’I’ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,’ he said quietly; ’not
that I was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I
felt you were only partly responsible for that; and Catherine
wishing to keep up your acquaintance, I acquiesced - foolishly.
Your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most
virtuous:  for that cause, and to prevent worse consequences, I
shall deny you hereafter admission into this house, and give notice
now that I require your instant departure.  Three minutes’ delay
will render it involuntary and ignominious.
</p>

<p id="id1032864"><span id="id115565"><!--anchor--></span>
Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an
eye full of derision.
</p>

<p id="id1032871"><span id="id115574"><!--anchor--></span>
’Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!’ he said.  ’It is
in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles.  By God!  Mr.
Linton, I’m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!’
</p>

<p id="id1032879"><span id="id115588"><!--anchor--></span>
My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the
men:  he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter.  I
obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed;
and when I attempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the
door to, and locked it.
</p>

<p id="id1032882"><span id="id115599"><!--anchor--></span>
’Fair means!’ she said, in answer to her husband’s look of angry
surprise.  ’If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology,
or allow yourself to be beaten.  It will correct you of feigning
more valour than you possess.  No, I’ll swallow the key before you
shall get it!  I’m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each!
After constant indulgence of one’s weak nature, and the other’s bad
one, I earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to
absurdity!  Edgar, I was defending you and yours; and I wish
Heathcliff may flog you sick, for daring to think an evil thought
of me!’
</p>

<p id="id1032885"><span id="id115606"><!--anchor--></span>
It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on
the master.  He tried to wrest the key from Catherine’s grasp, and
for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire;
whereupon Mr. Edgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his
countenance grew deadly pale.  For his life he could not avert that
excess of emotion:  mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him
completely.  He leant on the back of a chair, and covered his face.
</p>

<p id="id1032888"><span id="id115615"><!--anchor--></span>
’Oh, heavens!  In old days this would win you knighthood!’
exclaimed Mrs. Linton.  ’We are vanquished! we are vanquished!
Heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would
march his army against a colony of mice.  Cheer up! you sha’n’t be
hurt!  Your type is not a lamb, it’s a sucking leveret.’
</p>

<p id="id1032858"><span id="id115620"><!--anchor--></span>
’I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!’ said her
friend.  ’I compliment you on your taste.  And that is the
slavering, shivering thing you preferred to me!  I would not strike
him with my fist, but I’d kick him with my foot, and experience
considerable satisfaction.  Is he weeping, or is he going to faint
for fear?’
</p>

<p id="id1032894"><span id="id115627"><!--anchor--></span>
The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a
push.  He’d better have kept his distance:  my master quickly
sprang erect, and struck him full on the throat a blow that would
have levelled a slighter man.  It took his breath for a minute; and
while he choked, Mr. Linton walked out by the back door into the
yard, and from thence to the front entrance.
</p>

<p id="id1032898"><span id="id115635"><!--anchor--></span>
’There! you’ve done with coming here,’ cried Catherine.  ’Get away,
now; he’ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen
assistants.  If he did overhear us, of course he’d never forgive
you.  You’ve played me an ill turn, Heathcliff!  But go - make
haste!  I’d rather see Edgar at bay than you.’
</p>

<p id="id1032901"><span id="id115641"><!--anchor--></span>
’Do you suppose I’m going with that blow burning in my gullet?’ he
thundered.  ’By hell, no!  I’ll crush his ribs in like a rotten
hazel-nut before I cross the threshold!  If I don’t floor him now,
I shall murder him some time; so, as you value his existence, let
me get at him!’
</p>

<p id="id1032905"><span id="id115647"><!--anchor--></span>
’He is not coming,’ I interposed, framing a bit of a lie.  ’There’s
the coachman and the two gardeners; you’ll surely not wait to be
thrust into the road by them!  Each has a bludgeon; and master
will, very likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that
they fulfil his orders.’
</p>

<p id="id1032908"><span id="id115654"><!--anchor--></span>
The gardeners and coachman were there:  but Linton was with them.
They had already entered the court.  Heathcliff, on the second
thoughts, resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings:
he seized the poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made
his escape as they tramped in.
</p>

<p id="id1032911"><span id="id115666"><!--anchor--></span>
Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her up-
stairs.  She did not know my share in contributing to the
disturbance, and I was anxious to keep her in ignorance.
</p>

<p id="id1032914"><span id="id115676"><!--anchor--></span>
’I’m nearly distracted, Nelly!’ she exclaimed, throwing herself on
the sofa.  ’A thousand smiths’ hammers are beating in my head!
Tell Isabella to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should
she or any one else aggravate my anger at present, I shall get
wild.  And, Nelly, say to Edgar, if you see him again to-night,
that I’m in danger of being seriously ill.  I wish it may prove
true.  He has startled and distressed me shockingly!  I want to
frighten him.  Besides, he might come and begin a string of abuse
or complainings; I’m certain I should recriminate, and God knows
where we should end!  Will you do so, my good Nelly?  You are aware
that I am no way blamable in this matter.  What possessed him to
turn listener?  Heathcliff’s talk was outrageous, after you left
us; but I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest
meant nothing.  Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool’s craving to
hear evil of self, that haunts some people like a demon!  Had Edgar
never gathered our conversation, he would never have been the worse
for it.  Really, when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of
displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for
him, I did not care hardly what they did to each other; especially
as I felt that, however the scene closed, we should all be driven
asunder for nobody knows how long!  Well, if I cannot keep
Heathcliff for my friend - if Edgar will be mean and jealous, I’ll
try to break their hearts by breaking my own.  That will be a
prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity!  But
it’s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I’d not take Linton
by surprise with it.  To this point he has been discreet in
dreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting
that policy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when
kindled, on frenzy.  I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of
that countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.’
</p>

<p id="id1032922"><span id="id115683"><!--anchor--></span>
The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no
doubt, rather exasperating:  for they were delivered in perfect
sincerity; but I believed a person who could plan the turning of
her fits of passion to account, beforehand, might, by exerting her
will, manage to control herself tolerably, even while under their
influence; and I did not wish to ’frighten’ her husband, as she
said, and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her
selfishness.  Therefore I said nothing when I met the master coming
towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of turning back to
listen whether they would resume their quarrel together.  He began
to speak first.
</p>

<p id="id1032896"><span id="id115690"><!--anchor--></span>
’Remain where you are, Catherine,’ he said; without any anger in
his voice, but with much sorrowful despondency.  ’I shall not stay.
I am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to
learn whether, after this evening’s events, you intend to continue
your intimacy with - ’
</p>

<p id="id1032929"><span id="id115697"><!--anchor--></span>
’Oh, for mercy’s sake,’ interrupted the mistress, stamping her
foot, ’for mercy’s sake, let us hear no more of it now!  Your cold
blood cannot be worked into a fever:  your veins are full of ice-
water; but mine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes
them dance.’
</p>

<p id="id1032926"><span id="id115704"><!--anchor--></span>
’To get rid of me, answer my question,’ persevered Mr. Linton.
’You must answer it; and that violence does not alarm me.  I have
found that you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please.  Will
you give up Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me?  It is
impossible for you to be MY friend and HIS at the same time; and I
absolutely REQUIRE to know which you choose.’
</p>

<p id="id1032934"><span id="id115711"><!--anchor--></span>
’I require to be let alone?’ exclaimed Catherine, furiously.  ’I
demand it!  Don’t you see I can scarcely stand?  Edgar, you - you
leave me!’

She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely.
It was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked
rages!  There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa,
and grinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash
them to splinters!  Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden
compunction and fear.  He told me to fetch some water.  She had no
breath for speaking.  I brought a glass full; and as she would not
drink, I sprinkled it on her face.  In a few seconds she stretched
herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while her cheeks, at
once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death.  Linton
looked terrified.

’There is nothing in the world the matter,’ I whispered.  I did not
want him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my
heart.

’She has blood on her lips!’ he said, shuddering.

’Never mind!’ I answered, tartly.  And I told him how she had
resolved, previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy.  I
incautiously gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she
started up - her hair flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing,
the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally.  I
made up my mind for broken bones, at least; but she only glared
about her for an instant, and then rushed from the room.  The
master directed me to follow; I did, to her chamber-door:  she
hindered me from going further by securing it against me.

As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went
to ask whether she would have some carried up.  ’No!’ she replied,
peremptorily.  The same question was repeated at dinner and tea;
and again on the morrow after, and received the same answer.  Mr.
Linton, on his part, spent his time in the library, and did not
inquire concerning his wife’s occupations.  Isabella and he had had
an hour’s interview, during which he tried to elicit from her some
sentiment of proper horror for Heathcliff’s advances:  but he could
make nothing of her evasive replies, and was obliged to close the
examination unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning,
that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor,
it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and
him.
