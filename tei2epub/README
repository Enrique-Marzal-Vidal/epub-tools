ABOUT

tei2epub is a set of tools to convert TEI XML content into OPS/OPF
format ebooks.  

It should be trivial to adapt to other XML formats by replacing the
TEI XSLT with other stylesheets, and modifying the create_html()
method to chunk the output appropriately.


See http://www.idpf.org/ for more information about the epub format.



PREREQUISITES

tei2epub requires one non-standard Python module:

  * lxml (http://codespeak.net/lxml/)

However, feel free to replace it with your favorite Python XML
library.

and an implementation of ZIP ('zip' by default). 

To configure for your environment, modify:

  bin/settings.py


USAGE

  bin/tei2epub.py path-to-source-xml [alternate output name]

Without the second argument, tei2epub will strip any path and file
extension from our source XML and create a working directory in build/
and output directory in dist/ with the base name.  Otherwise you can
override that base name with the second argument.

TEI XSLT

tei2epub comes with a distribution of the TEI p5 stylesheets.  This
version comes with one slight modification to the code to avoid
producing documents with multiple duplicate IDs; it is suggested that
you experiment with your own version of the stylesheets if you get
validation errors.

For reference, the change is in xhtml/core.xsl at line 1063.
 
Other versions are available from:

  * http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/get.xml


TESTING

The distribution includes a version of epubcheck, which is officially distributed
at http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/

epubcheck is a Java application that can be run from the command line as:

  java -jar epubcheck-xxx.jar epub-bundle.epub

Where xxx is the version number of the included version of epubcheck.

tei2epub will automatically run epubcheck after a build, unless
disabled in settings.py.


SAMPLE

To test your installation, see instructions in the 'sample' folder,
which includes a validated TEI document.
